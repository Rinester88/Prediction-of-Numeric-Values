# Prediction-of-Numeric-Values
Problem Definition
Common Instructions

Use Pandas to Import the Dataset(House price)
Do the necessary Exploratory Data Analysis
Use the train_test_split method available in SCIKIT to split the dataset into Train Dataset and Test Dataset.
Show the Regression Score, Intercept and other parameters etc in the Output
Use visualizations and plots wherever possible
Format the outputs neatly; Do Documentation, Data Set Description, Objectives, Observations, Conclusions etc as you have done in your previous lab
Questions

What are your observations on the Dataset?
What are the different Error Measures (Evaluation Metrics) in relation to Linear Regression? How much do you get in the above cases?
Note down the errors/losses when the train-test ratio is 50:50, 60:40, 70:30, and 80:20
During LinearRegression() process, what is the impact of giving TRUE/FALSE as the value for Normalize Parameter?
Cases Try to predict the rent of the below houses -

1 BHK with 2 Baths in Portofino Street
Fully Furnished 2 BHK in School Street
Single Room anywhere in Lavasa
